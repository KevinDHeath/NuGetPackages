# Font Awesome Upgrade

In Font Awesome v6.5.2 the supplied TrueType font files have been restructured with the single file being split into 3. It was therefore decided to use the SVG files instead which means that the styles no longer set the button text.

:warning: This change requires that any button that currently uses one of the toolbar button styles needs to assign an image instead.

```xml
<Button ToolTip="Add 1" Style="{StaticResource toolbarButtonPlusStyle}">
  <Image Height="14" Width="14" Source="{StaticResource fa-solid-plus}"/>
</Button>
```

These are the affected toolbar button styles:

| **Style Name** | **Button Image** |
| :----------| :--------- |
| toolbarButtonOpenStyle | fa-regular-folder-open |
| toolbarButtonPlusStyle | fa-solid-plus |

A benefit is that the height and width of the image can be controlled independently of the button size.
