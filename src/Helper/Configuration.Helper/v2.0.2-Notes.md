# Version 2.0.2 Refactoring Notes
Refactoring is the process of restructuring code to improve the design, structure, implementation, code readability, and reduce complexities.

## Exception handling
The following methods have changes in their exception handling:

**ConfigFileHelper**
- `GetSecureSetting` now throws `ArgumentException` when `sectionName` parameter is empty.

**ISettingStore**
- `GetSection` now throws `ArgumentException, ArgumentNullException`

**SettingStoreBase**
- `GetSection` now throws `ArgumentException, ArgumentNullException`
- `LoadFromStream` no longer throws `ArgumentNullException`

## Cyclomatic complexity
The aim was to reduce all methods with a score of 30 or more.
> 30 is the default that triggers a risk hotspot on the report.

`AlphanumComparator.Compare` method reduced from 38 to 22.
