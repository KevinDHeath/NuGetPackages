# Version 2.1.0 Notes
There are breaking changes in this release due to the Model and Property name changes to allow for multi-country address data. This will affect databases that may be used to persist data for the models.

## Property changes
- The `Address` model properties `State` has been renamed as `Province`, and `ZipCode` is now `Postcode`. This affects the `Company` and `Person` models as they both contain an `Address` property.
- The `Person` model also had a property named `IdState` which has been renamed to `IdProvince`.

If you are using the Entity Framework to generate the database model then all these changes will be handled automatically.

If you manually created a database containing tables to persist data then you must execute the following SQL scripts to modify the tables.
```sql
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Companies.Address_State', 'Address_Province', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Companies.Address_ZipCode', 'Address_Postcode', 'COLUMN';

EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.People.Address_State', 'Address_Province', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.People.Address_ZipCode', 'Address_Postcode', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.People.IdState', 'IdProvince', 'COLUMN';
```
> **Note:** Modify the table names depending on your database structure.

## Model changes
The `USZipcode` and `USState` models have been renamed as `Postcode` and `Province` to allow for multi-country address data.

Unfortunately, if you are using the Entity Framework then the old tables will be dropped and the new ones created without any data.

**Important** Please make sure to copy the old tables _before_ apply any EF migrations so that you can manually map the data back into the new tables.

If you manually created a database containing these tables then you must execute the following SQL scripts to convert the old tables.
```sql
DROP INDEX [dbo].[USStates].[IX_USStates_Alpha];
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[USStates] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK_USStates];
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.USStates', 'Provinces';
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Provinces.Alpha', 'Code', 'COLUMN';
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Provinces] DROP COLUMN [Capital];
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Provinces] ADD CONSTRAINT [PK_Provinces] PRIMARY Key ([Id]);
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IX_Provinces_Code] ON [dbo].[Provinces] ([Code] ASC);

DROP INDEX [dbo].[USZipCodes].[IX_USZipCodes_ZipCode];
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[USZipCodes] DROP CONSTRAINT [PK_USZipCodes];
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.USZipCodes', 'Postcodes';
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Postcodes.ZipCode', 'Code', 'COLUMN';
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Postcodes.State', 'Province', 'COLUMN';
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Postcodes] ALTER COLUMN [Code] nvarchar(10) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Postcodes] ALTER COLUMN [Province] nvarchar(10) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Postcodes] ALTER COLUMN [City] nvarchar(50) NULL;
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Postcodes] ALTER COLUMN [County] nvarchar(50) NULL;
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Postcodes] ADD CONSTRAINT [PK_Postcodes] PRIMARY Key ([Id]);
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [IX_Postcodes_Code] ON [dbo].[Postcodes] ([Code] ASC);
```
> **Note:** Modify the table, constraint, and index names depending on your database structure.
